git: fatal: Could not read from remote repository

I am trying to set git up with http://danielmiessler.com/study/git/#website to manage my site.

I have gotten to the last step in the instructions: git push website +master:refs/heads/master

I am working using the git ming32 command line in win7

$ git push website +master:refs/heads/master
Bill@***.com's password:
Connection closed by 198.91.80.3
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

Please make sure you have the correct access rights
and the repository exists.
One problem here may be that the program is looking for Bill@***.com. when I connect via ssh to my site I have a different username( lets say 'abc'). so maybe this should be abc@***.com. If so I don't know how to change this or if I can push under an alias

I had the same issue, sometimes this error happens when git server isn't reachable or has something like "internal server error". 每 Morteza Ziaeemehr Mar 6 '14 at 14:21

You can specify the username that SSH should send to the remote system as part of your remote's URL. Put the username, followed by an @, before the remote hostname.

git remote set-url website abc@***.com:path/to/repo

Make sure you have correct url in .git/config

url = git@github.com:username/repo.git
If it's your first push, you'll need to set up correct upstream

$ git push -u origin master
You can check which key is used by:

$ ssh -vvv git@github.com
The reply should contain something like this:

debug1: Next authentication method: publickey
debug1: Offering RSA public key: ~/.ssh/id_rsa
...
You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
Also it's possible to define rules for ssh in ~/.ssh/config, e.g. based on aliases:

   Host github
      HostName github.com 
      User git
      IdentityFile "~/.ssh/id_rsa"

   Host git
      HostName github.com 
      User git
      IdentityFile "~/.ssh/some_other_id"
You can set connect to different ports, use different username etc. for each alias.

Thank you!! At some point when I cloned my repo, the url was set to https://github.com/user/repo.git (without git@github.com) and so it refused to use my SSH key. Maybe it's because I cloned it using GIthub for Windows originally (?) 每 Jedidja Apr 30 '15 at 13:00

Try removing the GIT_SSH environment variable with unset GIT_SSH. This was the cause of my problem.

After doing some research I've finally got solution for this, you have declared a environment variable to plink.exe path. So if you remove that path, reopen the git bash and try cloning through SSH it will work.

I had the same error. The solution was following: I've corrected my url in .git/config. Just copied that from HTTPS clone URL. That would be something like that:

url = https://github.com/*your*git*name*/*your*git*app*.git
It worked.

Make sure ssh-agent is running: eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"

i just wanted to share that i found a easy fix for that:

Access denied. fatal: Could not read from remote repository. Please make sure you have the correct access rights and the repository exists.

just logout from gitlab and login again. The problems should then be fixed.

In your .git/config file

[remote "YOUR_APP_NAME"]
    url = git@heroku.com:YOUR_APP_NAME.git
    fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/YOUR_APP_NAME/*
And simply

git push YOUR_APP_NAME master:master

Another workaround:

Sometimes this happens to me because of network problems. I don't understand the root problem fully, but switching to a different sub-network or using VPN solves it

For my case, I am using Corporate network (without internet connection) in office. In order to pull code from github, I set https proxy in gitbash and then use https instead of ssh to pull code,it works fine. However when comes to push code, the https proxy won't work. So either switch to Internet network (with internet connection) or set ssh proxy can solve the problem.

This is usually caused due to the SSH key is not matching with the remote.

Solutions:

Go to terminal and type the following command (Mac, Linux) replace with your email id.

ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "you@email.com"
Copy the generated key using following command starting from word ssh.

cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
Paste it in github, bitbucket or gitlab respective of your remote.
Save it.

Actually I tried a lot of things to make it work on Win7, since changing the SSH exectun fron native to build-it and backwards and the same error. By chance, i change it to HTTPS in the ".git/config" file as:

[remote "origin"]
        url = https://github.com/user_name/repository_name.git
        fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
and it finally worked. So maybe it could work for you as well.

For those having this problem on a private remote repo. make sure you have accepted the Xcode agreement on the remote server: it took we weeks to find out this fix

Use this command from the command line: sudo xcodebuild -license

I just wanted to add to this question. I had Git setup to use PLink and Pageant for authentication and I was also getting the error FATAL ERROR: Disconnected: No supported authentication methods available (server sent: publickey). I had Pageant opened but the error was still showing up. The problem? I didn't have the private key loaded in Pageant (to add a key, follow these instructions). It was that simple.
